## Customizable Battle Grid and Tiles

This feature allows the users to input the dimensions of their desired grid and display a "battle grid" to provide a visual supplement to the world of the players' Dungeons &amp Dragons campaign. Each tile in the grid will be a square, and the user will have the option to select what type of terrain each tile will represent (i.e. grass, stone, castle, etc.) as well as choose its color. The user would also be able to drag and drop the tiles onto their desired spots, updating the grid in real-time.

## Dynamic Token/Character Positioning and Stats

A token is an object that can be placed on a single tile of the battle grid. It is represented by an image superimposed on a tile, and it houses customizable stats that can be viewed when the user's mouse is hovered over it. The user can choose what these tokens represent in the context of game-play, such as a playable character, NPCs, enemies, or obstacles. Its position on the battle grid can be changed by simply dragging and dropping the tokens on to a desired tile.

## Image Import

This feature allows users to import images into the web application, giving them the freedom to choose any image they want to represent any tiles or any tokens on the battle grid.

## Drawing 

In order to facilitate the discussion of strategies amidst a campaign, users will be able to enter a specific mode where they can use their mouse to draw over the battle grid with a virtual pen. This virtual pen will be adjustable by the user in both size and color. The user will also be able to erase their drawing either with an eraser tool or via a "clear all" option.

## Customizable Dice Roller

The web application will provide the users with an option to use virtual dice. The dice will be fully customizable, as the user will be able to adjust the number of sides on the dice as well as if they want to add in custom numbers. The user will be able to roll the dice at any point in the campaign.

## Data Tracking/Saving

This web application will save user data in local storage, so that information like the grid layout, tokens, characters, stats, token/character positions, dice settings, imported images, and drawings are all saved so that when the user leaves the web application and returns to it on their browser, all of this information will be restored. However, the user will have the option to completely wipe this data to start over from a clean slate. This is important as there is a lot of data players need to keep track of between campaign sessions.
