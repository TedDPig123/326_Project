# Data Relationships

- **Map to Character**: One-to-many relationship (a Map can have many Character).
- **Map to Object**: One-to-many relationship (a Map can have many Object).
- **Map to Terrain**: One-to-many relationship (a map can have many Terrain).
- **Map to Drawing**: One-to-many relationship (a map can have many Drawing).
- **Map to Dice roll**: One-to-one relationship (a map can have one Dice roll bar).

## Data Sources

- **User-Input Data**: This is all of the data, including character, object, Terrain and map generation.
And also dice roll input and drawing input.

- **System-Generated Data**: 
The result of the dice roll will be automatically calculated by the system according to the user input. 
And there will be a default battle map with default grid size and a white background generated by the system. 
The system will automatically store the state and information of things associated with each unique `map_id`.
