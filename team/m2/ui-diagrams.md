1. **UI Diagrams**: Include diagrams or sketches of the key screens or interfaces of your application. These diagrams should show the layout, key elements, and user interactions on each screen. You can use wireframes, mockups, or hand-drawn sketches, as long as they are clear and demonstrate the major components of your UI.

2. **Explanation of Each Diagram**: Along with each diagram, provide a brief description of what the user will see and do on that screen. Explain how the user will interact with the application, what actions they can take, and how each screen connects to the overall user experience.

3. **Use Cases**: For each diagram, describe the specific user scenarios or "use cases" that demonstrate how users will interact with the application. For example, explain how a user might navigate from one screen to another, complete a task, or achieve a goal within the application.
