This shows the main layout of the website. The goal is to display the current state of an ongoing combat in Dungeons & Dragons, giving users the ability to make the map, and update character positions and statuses as combat progresses. Here, you can see a sample state of 3 characters (represented by Tokens) positioned around a dragon they're fighting, on a map with various different terrains and objects. On the left is a toolbar for editing the map, and hovering over an Object allows it to display neccesary information.

This showcases the main method of moving tokens: dragging. You can simply drag and drop a token to move it to a new space.

This shows the options for creating a token. You import an image to use, and a text field allows you to put any neccesary information, which is what will be displayed when you hover over that token.

This shows the menu for creating terrain. Terrain is simply a portion of color-coded tiles, with an effect given by text input that displays when you hover over it.

This shows the menu for drawing on the map. Simply choose a color, a tool (such as freehand, or a shape tool, or the eraser) and you can freely doodle quick notes or markers or anything else you need.

This shows the menu for rolling dice. You use the numerical inputs to decide how many dice to roll, and how many sides those dice have (EX: 5d10 represents rolling 5 10-sided dice), and it will roll them and display the result in the same window.
