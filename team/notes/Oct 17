Notes from First meeting

from 1:05 pm to 2:06 pm 

dnd campaign website 

(everyone moreso fell in line to agree with idea, since it seems pretty simple in concept) 

other alternative was to have a website that makes a character map, but perhaps this idea might be scrapped since not a lot of people within the group have much knowledge on DND lore/background of the table top game 

personal thought: since we have a large group, perhaps we can merge the two ideas together if there's not enough work to go around?))

take an image and place it on the website (to represent the terrain) pixel art for it? 
terrain 
enemies 
objects (walls, buildings), 

perhaps free to take art (default assets) 

give the user the option to change the picture of their character (can be imported) 

<<we were just setting up the stuff>>

<<everyone then proceeded to choose their roles>> 



place and move characters on the map (battle map) 

tiles will be customizable


we are now choosing the roles for each member (i still do not know their names) 

first gotta get it to work first 

full stack - 

front end - Casey, 

back end - 


back end is just creating the foundation with it (

we are now reading the instructions (aka people are looking at the example docs for reference) 

instead of assigning roles such as front end, back end, etc, we are now looking at the roles section and determining what we can do 

we are now assigning official roles to each person (we are still on this) 

for the battle grid, you can choose the sides (how many rows how many columns), you can also import images/customizable tile 

being able to select a different type of tile you want to put down 

save the file as a custom file type (instead of png) 

a custom file type to get everything back in (set it up as a raw text file and we can set it up with an encoder/decoder) 

gerli just updated the features.md file to have the following features, "customizable battle grid and tiles" 
"dynamic character positioning and stats"
"image import"
"drawing"
"customizable dice roller"
"data tracking/save"  

"if we're going to keep track of character stats, we need characters" - geri
we are thinking of having all those character stats merged within characters (as a feature)
subfeatures will be created (to have more stuff to do) 
make the user do everything 
instead of doing specific terrain, new terrain (button) type in yourself what it does (tiles that are red do this, tiles that are blue do this) 
this allows more diversity and freedom for the users 
token? uses the same thing as a character (a tree token (a tree image), to decorate (decorations are going to be using tokens (similar to character tokens. might be interactable?)) 
tokens are a layer above the tile 
would each tile represent a grid? 
a token is as big as a grid space (to make sure it isn't over complicated) (aka the token would be three spaces long instead of just taking one space to block the user from advancing) 
definition: a piece that you can move around, and has information stored within it (there are subclasses for characters, items, etc) 
just a name/description
