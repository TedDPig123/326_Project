# Meeting Information: 
- Location: Science and Engineering Building 
- Date: 10/17/2024
- Time: From 1:05 pm to 2:06 pm 

# Notes: 
- Main idea for the project was proposed by the already existing members of this team, which included Casey, Geri and Shanzay. This idea was a DND campaign website, and it seems like none of the newer team members were opposed to this idea 
- The team agreed that it seems pretty simple in concept, and generally something that can be expanded on if necessary 
- Other alternative ideas was to have a website use a character map, but Casey mentioned this idea might need to be scrapped since the newer members don't have much knowledge on DND lore/game (just the general basics) 
- (Personal thought: since we have a large group, perhaps we can merge the two ideas together if there's not enough work to go around?)
- Ideas of pixel art style was tossed around to use it for the website to represent the following objects: terrain, enemies, walls, buildings, actual objects you can interact with in game, etc
- (Personal note: I forgot I had acesprite (a pixel art software). Maybe I could help?) 
- During the development phase of the project, the team concluded its best to use default assets while we're attempting to get everything running first 
- The idea of having the user be free  to change the picture of their avatar via image import was brought up 
- The group decided to have a battle map be their main idea for their website, and for the players to be able to place and move their characters on said map 
- The tiles on the battle map will be customizable (?)
- Roles are being chosen, but they have not been finalized yet 
- We are in the process of creating the repository and setting up all the files 
- For the battle grid, you can choose the sides (how many rows how many columns), you can also import images/customizable tile and are able to select the different types of tile you want to put down 
- The idea to save the work as a different file type compared to just saving it as a PNG was brought up (very smart) 
- The basis is if we have a custom file type, we can have it be a raw text file and easily perform encryption/decription on it to get all the information back. Information that includes health bars, xp, all that stuff I assume)
- Geri updated the features.md to have the following features: 
- "customizable battle grid and tiles" 
- "dynamic character positioning and stats"
- "image import"
- "drawing"
- "customizable dice roller"
- "data tracking/save"  
- "If we're going to keep track of character stats, we need characters" - Geri
we are thinking of having all those character stats merged within characters (as a feature)
subfeatures will be created (to have more stuff to do) 
make the user do everything 
instead of doing specific terrain, new terrain (button) type in yourself what it does (tiles that are red do this, tiles that are blue do this) 
this allows more diversity and freedom for the users 
token? uses the same thing as a character (a tree token (a tree image), to decorate (decorations are going to be using tokens (similar to character tokens. might be interactable?)) 
tokens are a layer above the tile 
would each tile represent a grid? 
a token is as big as a grid space (to make sure it isn't over complicated) (aka the token would be three spaces long instead of just taking one space to block the user from advancing) 
definition: a piece that you can move around, and has information stored within it (there are subclasses for characters, items, etc) 
just a name/description

# Notes to self:
- Ask team if I can record their conversation next time (?). Mostly to have as back up in case I forget to write something down
