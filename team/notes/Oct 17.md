# Meeting Information: 
- Location: Science and Engineering Building 
- Date: 10/17/2024
- Time: From 1:05 pm to 2:06 pm 

# Notes: 
- Main idea for the project was proposed by the already existing members of this team, which included Casey, Geri and Shanzay. This idea was a DND campaign website, and it seems like none of the newer team members were opposed to this idea 
- The team agreed that it seems pretty simple in concept, and generally something that can be expanded on if necessary 
- Other alternative ideas was to have a website use a character map, but Casey mentioned this idea might need to be scrapped since the newer members don't have much knowledge on DND lore/game (just the general basics) 
- (Personal thought: since we have a large group, perhaps we can merge the two ideas together if there's not enough work to go around?)
- Ideas of pixel art style was tossed around to use it for the website to represent the following objects: terrain, enemies, walls, buildings, actual objects you can interact with in game, etc
- (Personal note: I forgot I had acesprite (a pixel art software). Maybe I could help?) 
- During the development phase of the project, the team concluded its best to use default assets while we're attempting to get everything running first 
- The idea of having the user be free  to change the picture of their avatar via image import was brought up 
- The group decided to have a battle map be their main idea for their website, and for the players to be able to place and move their characters on said map 
- The tiles on the battle map will be customizable (?)
- Roles are being chosen, but they have not been finalized yet 
- We are in the process of creating the repository and setting up all the files 
- For the battle grid, you can choose the sides (how many rows how many columns), you can also import images/customizable tile and are able to select the different types of tile you want to put down 
- The idea to save the work as a different file type compared to just saving it as a PNG was brought up (very smart) 
- The basis is if we have a custom file type, we can have it be a raw text file and easily perform encryption/decription on it to get all the information back. Information that includes health bars, xp, all that stuff I assume)
- Geri updated the features.md to have the following features: 
- "customizable battle grid and tiles" 
- "dynamic character positioning and stats"
- "image import"
- "drawing"
- "customizable dice roller"
- "data tracking/save"  
- "If we're going to keep track of character stats, we need characters" - Geri
- The team is thinking about having all character stats be merged within the character token, but carry them as seperate features
- Instead of doing specific terrain, new terrain (button) type in yourself what it does (tiles that are red do this, tiles that are blue do this) 
- The user will also have the freedom to place it anywhere among the map, at it allows more diversity and freedom
- Token: The definition of the token just an object that has a name attached to it. This could refer to character tokens, a tree token, etc. The real issue will be noting which tokens are and aren't interactible with
- Also tokens will be placed a layer above the tile (aka the terrain/main layer) and will be big enough to cover a square/a grid space
- 
# Notes to self:
- Ask team if I can record their conversation next time (?). Mostly to have as back up in case I forget to write something down
